#AIR POLLUTION NOTES OCTOBER 15 2019

EXAM 2 NEXT WEEK

*COMMON PURPUSES FOR AIR DISPERSION MODELING
 permitting new sources of air pollution, Developing air pollution control strategies in non attaintment areas
 Developing new regulations. determining patterns of contaminated areas from historic air emissions.Transportation planning.
 environmental impact statements

 *Goals of air dispertion MODELING
 estimate concentrations of pollutanst for ambient air quality standards
 toxic air polluttans
 preventions of significant deteriotation
 provide cost effective stimates over large areas.

 *ACCURACY OF DISPERSION MODELS
 uncertainties can be large
 accuracy depends on:
    -physics and chemestry eqns
    -uncertainties in measurements.

*TYPES OF MODELS
Gaussian Plume Models. Approximates plume behavior. Concentration is dispersed in horizontal and vertical.
Uses steady-state meteorology. do not use chemical reactions.Most common type for air quality permitting.

*NUMERICAL OF GRID MODELS
